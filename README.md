# MAOMAO
MAOMAO is a single-player arcade-style, side-scrolling, platformer game. The player controls a cat named MAOMAO whose goal is to rescue his friends who got kidnapped by the King Crab. MAOMAO must clear the obstacles in the Crab Castle to successfully reach the final room and save all his friends. The game ends when MAOMAO loses all his lives or completes all levels. The game is appealing to players who like “Castlevania” style platformers, or have an interest in simple narratives involving a hero saving his friends.

Objectives/goals: The objective of MAOMAO is to save all his friends and escape the castle safely.

Difficulties: Players must be able to clear the obstacles in each stage safely. As the lives are carried over onto the next level, players must strategically navigate each level to ensure they will have enough lives to sustain themselves throughout the game. 

Game over: The game ends when MAOMAO loses all his lives or completes all levels.
